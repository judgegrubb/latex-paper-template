# A Simple Latex Paper Template

This is the basic latex paper template I've been putting together slowly over
the last few years. Whenever I am in charge of starting a new paper, I have
found this to be a great launching point.

This uses the awesome work of the
[latexrun](https://github.com/aclements/latexrun) project to keep things simple
for compiling code and dealing with dependencies and error messages.

Make sure to set the name of your core `.tex` file in `Makefile`. By default,
that is the `paper.tex` file. From there it should be relatively simple to
build out a many-tex file template for your paper and easily scale between
solo and a multi-authored paper.

This is mostly for me and the design reflects that. However if anyone else finds
it useful, that would be awesome! Let me know if you have any questions.
